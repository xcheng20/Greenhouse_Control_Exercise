# Exercise: Temperature Control in a Greenhouse

**Objective:** To design and compare two control strategies for regulating the temperature inside a lettuce greenhouse: a simple **Heuristic Feedforward Controller** and an advanced **Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC)**. The controllers should track temperature setpoints of 18°C during the day and 12°C in the evening.

**Context:** Greenhouses allow us to grow crops year-round, but maintaining the optimal temperature requires careful management of resources like heating and ventilation. The goal is to track the specified temperature setpoints to support healthy crop growth while considering operational constraints.
